# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Folder Structure

1. Question 1 and 2 files can be found within `/src`. Each component is housed in one folder with its own .css file.
2. Once localhost is up and running, you can navigate to page with the buttons at the bottom left of the page.
3. MCQs and Question 3 are stored in the root directory.

## Running The Repo

1. Install necessary dependencies with `npm i`.
2. Start localhost with `npm start`.
3. To run the .ts file, compile it into JS with `tsc twoSum.ts`.
4. View console.log outputs with `node twoSum.js`

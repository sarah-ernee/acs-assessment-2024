# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Cloning The Repo

1. Run `npm i` to install necessary dependencies.
2. Run localhost with command `npm run dev`.

## Navigation

1. Question 1 and 2 files can be found within /src. Each component is housed in one folder with its own .css file.
2. Once localhost is up and running, you can navigate to page with the buttons at the bottom left of the page.
3. MCQs and Question 3 are stored in the root directory.

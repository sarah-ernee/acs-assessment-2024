# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Cloning The Repo

1. Run `npm i` to install necessary dependencies.
2. Run localhost with command `npm run dev`.

## Navigation

1. For a cleaner repo, Question 1 and 2 (the React parts) are contained in the /src folder.
2. Once localhost is up and running, you can navigate to each components with the setup BrowserRouter.
3. MCQs and Question 3 are stored in the root directory.
